# Graph

:octocat: This is a project for **Graph Search** Methods in Unity3D and C#. :alien:

## What we have
* DFS (Breadth First Search)
* DFS (Depth First Search)
* UCS (Uniform Cost Search)

## How to use
[Install Unity3d](https://unity3d.com)
1. Set the start node **[mouse click]**
2. Set the target node **[mouse over + space bar]**
3. Hit the search buttons

## Using your own graph
   Besides the default graph provided, you can create your own graph!
   In the Unity menu:
   
      Assets -> Create -> My Graph

This will create a new graph object serialized as a Unity **.asset** file (stored in ~/Graph/Assets/Graphs/Graph.asset)

## About
This project is develop for the Artificial Intelligence course for my Computer Science undergrad at UNESP - SP - Brazil
